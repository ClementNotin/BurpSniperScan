# Sniper scan

## Description
This Burp extension lets the user select a region of a request (typically a parameter value), and via the context menu do an active scan of just the insertion point defined by that selection.
It is similar with the "actively scan defined insertion points" feature in the context menu of the Intruder, without the burden of having to send the request to the Intruder.
Just right click on a request and select *"Scan manual insertion point"*.
